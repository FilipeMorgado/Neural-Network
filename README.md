# Neural-Network
**Project carried out for a Knowledge and Reasoning class at ISEC.**\
Project carried out in Matlab focusing on the study of neural networks implementing and testing different architectures of feedforward neural networks to correctly classify 10 Greek characters.

This project tested the most diverse ***topologies***:
- FeedForwardNet
- PatternNet
- FitNet


***training functions***:
- trainrp
- traingd
- trainlm
- trainoss
- trainscg


***and activation functions***:
- tansig
- logsig
- radbasn
- purelin


***dataset activation***, ***epochs*** and also the number of ***hidden layers*** as well
as the ***number of neurons per layer*** in order to optimize the neural network
to be created for better accuracy in image analysis and at the same time acquiring
knowledge of the impact of each parameter on neural networks.

## Usage
To be able to upload the entirety of the project to GitHub, the *img* folder had to be zipped. You need to unzip the folder to run the project.

## Files
To get a better understanding of everything that is implemented and the project, the guide for this has been left with the files.\
The entire project is in Portuguese.\
